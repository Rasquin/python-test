# byotest

## challenge I 

tests that fail the test_not_equal, and test_is_in test methods. 
Verify that the message is correct for the values given.

## challenge II

Write test methods for test_not_in which tests than an item is not in a 
collection, and test_between which tests that a value is between a lower and 
upper limit, inclusive.

## challenge II vending_machine
Make sure the file is called byotest and remove the number_of_evens function 
and the call to the test_are_equal function at the end. This should leave you 
with the remaining test functions that we'll import from here when we wish to 
write our tests later on
